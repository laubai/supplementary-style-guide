[[data-compression]]
==== image:images/caution.png[with caution] data compression (noun)
*Description*: Data compression is a method of encoding data using fewer bits than the original data. How compression is achieved differs across products and should always be clarified.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux and solutions built on top of it, Virtual Disk Optimization (VDO) uses HIOPS compression, which operates on blocks that have not been identified as duplicates. When unique data is seen for the first time, it is compressed. Subsequent copies of data that have already been stored are then deduplicated without requiring an additional compression step.

Migration compression is specific to Red Hat Virtualization, and is the compression of virtual machine image information while a running virtual machine is moved from one server to another. It uses Xor Based Zero Run Length Encoding (XBZRLE) as the compression mechanism.

LZO compression and LZ4 compression are specific compression algorithms, so they are specific enough.

[[deduplication]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] deduplication (noun)
*Description*: A feature of virtual disk optimization (VDO) that helps conserve storage space by eliminating multiple copies of duplicate blocks. Instead of writing the same data more than once, VDO detects blocks that are duplicates of an existing block, and records them as a reference to the original block. VDO maintains a mapping from logical block addresses, which are used by the storage layer above VDO, to physical block addresses, which are used by the storage layer under VDO. After deduplication, multiple logical block addresses may be mapped to the same physical block address; these are called shared blocks. Block sharing is invisible to users of the storage, who read and write blocks as they would if VDO were not present. When a shared block is overwritten, a new physical block is allocated for storing the new block data to ensure that other logical block addresses that are mapped to the shared physical block are not modified.
