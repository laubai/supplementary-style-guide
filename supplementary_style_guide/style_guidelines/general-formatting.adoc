[[general-formatting]]
= General formatting

[[date-formats]]
== Date formats

Follow the _IBM Style Guide_  guidance of _day Month year_ for date formats, for example, 3 October 2019.

When the format _day Month year_ causes a presentation or clarity issue, use _Month day, year_ (for example, October 3, 2019) instead.


[[conscious-language]]
== Conscious language

The Conscious Language Group supports the Red Hat commitment to remove problematic language from our code, documentation, websites, and open source projects with which Red Hat is involved.
For more information about the Conscious Language Group, see https://github.com/conscious-lang/conscious-lang-docs.

=== blacklist and whitelist

When possible, rewrite documentation to avoid these terms.


.Example: Removing 'blacklist'
image:images/no.png[no] Heat blacklists any servers in the list from receiving updated heat deployments. After the stack operation completes, any blacklisted servers remain unchanged. You can also power off or stop the `os-collect-config` agents during the operation.

image:images/yes.png[yes] Heat excludes any servers in the list from receiving updated heat deployments. After the stack operation completes, any excluded servers remain unchanged. You can also power off or stop the `os-collect-config` agents during the operation.


.Example: Removing 'whitelist'
image:images/no.png[no] The following steps demonstrate adding a new rule to whitelist a custom binary.

image:images/yes.png[yes] The following steps demonstrate adding a new rule to allow a custom binary.

When it is not possible to remove the terms 'blacklist' and 'whitelist', replace them with one of the following alternatives:

* blocklist / allowlist: This combination is recommended by _The IBM Style Guide_. Use this combination unless your product area has another specific replacement that is agreed between engineering leadership and your documentation team.
* denylist / allowlist
* blocklist / passlist

[[conversational-style]]
== Conversational style

Follow the _IBM Style Guide_ guidance of _less conversational_ style in most cases.

As needed, adjust the conversational to _fairly conversational_ for an audience of new users or _least conversational_ for API documentation and other very experienced audiences.

.Example: Less conversational style

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 delivers a stable, secure, and consistent foundation across hybrid cloud deployments with the tools needed to deliver workloads faster with less effort.

[[contractions]]
== Contractions

Avoid contractions in product documentation to leave no ambiguity and to make it easier for translation and international audiences.

If you are writing quick start or other content that uses a more informal xref:#conversational-style[conversational style] (_fairly conversational_ or _more conversational_), you may use contractions. In this case, follow the guidance in the _IBM Style Guide_ on using contractions.

[[user-replaced-values]]
== User-replaced values

A _user-replaced value_, also known as a replaceable or variable value, is a value that the user must replace with a value that is relevant for their situation. User-replaced values are often found in places such as code blocks, file paths, and commands.

Use descriptive names for user-replaced values and follow this general format: _<value_name>_.

[NOTE]
====
For XML code blocks, see the guidance on xref:#user-replaced-values-xml[user-replaced values for XML].
====

Ensure that user-replaced values have the following characteristics:

* Surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`)
* Separated by underscores (`_`) for multi-word values
* Lowercase, unless the rest of the related text is uppercase or another capitalization scheme
* Italicized
* If the user-replaced value is referencing a value in code or in a command that is normally monospace, also use monospace for the user-replaced value

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value in a paragraph

----
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
----

This renders as:

====
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
====

To italicize a user-replaced value in a code block, you must add an attribute to apply text formatting, such as `subs="+quotes"` or `subs="normal"`, to the attribute list of the code block.

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value in a code block

  [subs="+quotes"]
  ----
  $ oc describe node __<node_name>__
  ----

This renders as:

====
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc describe node __<node_name>__
----
====

[[user-replaced-values-xml]]
== User-replaced values for XML

Because XML uses angle brackets (`< >`), the xref:#user-replaced-values[default guidance] for user-replaced values does not work well for it. If you are using user-replaced values in an XML code block, use the following format: _${value_name}_.

Ensure that user-replaced values in XML have the following characteristics:

* Surrounded by curly braces and preceded by a dollar sign (`${ }`)
* Separated by underscores (`_`) for multi-word values
* Lowercase, unless the rest of the related text is uppercase or another capitalization scheme
* Italicized
* If the user-replaced value is referencing a value in code or in a command that is normally monospace, also use monospace for the user-replaced value

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value for an XML element

  [source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
  ----
  <ipAddress>__${ip_address}__</ipAddress>
  ----

This renders as:

====
[source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
----
<ipAddress>__${ip_address}__</ipAddress>
----
====

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value for an XML attribute

  [source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
  ----
  <oauth2-introspection client-id="__${client_id}__"/>
  ----

This renders as:

====
[source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
----
<oauth2-introspection client-id="__${client_id}__"/>
----
====

[[lead-in-sentences]]
== Lead-in sentences for `Prerequisites` and `Procedure` sections

A lead-in sentence in this context is the text that directly follows a `Prerequisites` or `Procedure` heading in a task-based module. It is distinct from the module abstract, which describes the goals of the user for the module.

Do not use a lead-in sentence in the `Prerequisites` or `Procedure` sections of a module unless it is necessary to aid navigation or add clarity.

The following examples demonstrate when a lead-in sentence might add value.

* Your module has a long list of prerequisites, and you want to group the prerequisties in sections to make it easier for users to understand what tasks must be performed to complete a procedure.
* Your module has a complex procedure or set of prerequisites, and you want to emphasize that all steps or prerequisites must be completed.

Use a complete sentence for the lead-in sentence to reduce ambiguity and support translation.

[[single-step-procedures]]
== Single-step procedures

When a procedure contains only one step, use an unnumbered bullet.

For example:
====
* Install the `dnf-automatic` package.
====

[[admonitions]]
== Admonitions

Admonitions should draw the readerâ€™s attention to certain information. Keep admonitions to a minimum, and avoid placing multiple admonitions close to one another. If multiple admonitions are necessary, restructure the information by moving the less-important statements into the flow of the main content.

Valid admonition types:

NOTE:: Additional guidance or advice that improves product configuration, performance, or supportability.
IMPORTANT:: Advisory information essential to the completion of a task. Users must not disregard this information.
WARNING:: Information about potential system damage, data loss, or a support-related issue if the user disregards this admonition. Explain the problem, cause, and offer a solution that works. If available, offer information to avoid the problem in the future or state where to find more information.
TIP:: Alternative methods that might not be obvious. Makes applying the techniques and procedures described in the text easier or targets specific needs. Helps users understand the benefits and capabilities of the product. Not essential to using the product.

[IMPORTANT]
====
CAUTION, which is another type of AsciiDoc admonition, is not fully supported by the Red Hat Customer Portal. Do not use this admonition type.
====

Admonitions should be short and concise. Do not include procedures in an admonition.

Only individual admonitions are allowed, for example, you cannot have a plural *NOTES* heading.

.Example AsciiDoc
----
[NOTE]
====
Text for note.

[product-names-versions-ref]]
== Product names and version references

Whenever you refer to the name of your product in full, or in its abbreviated form, or when you refer to the major and minor version of your product, avoid using hard-coded references and use attributes instead.
Only use hard-coded version references if the version that you are referring to in a particular case never changes.

=== Attribute file

Define attributes for product name and product version and store them in a dedicated attributes file for each set of product documentation.
For examples of where you can store the shared attributes file inside your documentation repository, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/blob/mod-doc-repo-example/_artifacts/document-attributes.adoc[Example modular documentation repository].
Include the attributes file at the beginning of the `master.adoc` files of all titles in your documentation set:

.Example AsciiDoc: Attribute file included in a master.adoc file
[subs="+quotes"]
----
\include::__<path_to_directory_with_attributes_file>__/attributes.adoc[]
----

=== Minimum required attributes

Define attributes for the following values in each documentation set.
Note that the attribute names used in this section are only meant as examples.
You can use different attribute names:

The name of the product:: Use the product name attribute for all instances of the product name where possible.
Avoid using hard-coded product names.
For example:
+
.Example AsciiDoc: Product name attribute
----
:name-product: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
----

The abbreviated form of the product name:: If it is necessary for your product, you can use an attribute to store a shortened version of the name of your product, for example:
+
.Example AsciiDoc: Abbreviated product name attribute
----
:name-product-abbreviated: JBoss EAP
----

The major and minor version of the product:: Use an attribute for the product version in cases where the product version can change with each release and the content is still correct.
For example:
+
.Example AsciiDoc: Product version attributes
----
:version-product-minor: 1.11
:version-product-patch: 1.11.6
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not use the product version attribute if the version should not change.
For example, if a feature was introduced in a certain version, the version should be hard-coded.
====

You might create additional attributes according to what your documentation requires.
For example, you might combine existing product name attributes to create compound names of products or components:

.Example attributes for compound names of product components
----
:name-runtime-spring-boot: Spring Boot
:name-runtime-vertx: Eclipse Vert.x
:name-spring-reactive: {name-runtime-spring-boot} with {name-runtime-vertx} reactive components
----

[[statements-about-the-future]]
== Statements about future releases or plans

When possible, avoid making statements that predict future releases or plans.

However, some circumstances, such as release notes or deprecation notices, might dictate that you refer to a future release, plan, or event. 
In these situations, follow these guidelines:

* When discussing future plans, use words such as "anticipate", "expect", or "plan".
* Do not promise that a feature or a fix for a known issue will be included in an upcoming release or according to a specific timeline.
* Do not refer to a specific future release. For example, do not mention a particular release number or a specific release date.
+
[NOTE]
====
One exception to this rule applies to deprecation notices, which might have to specify a future release in which a feature or functions will be removed. 

See xref:release-notes[Release notes] for guidelines about deprecation notices. 
====

.Example: Bug fix statement
image:images/no.png[no] We will fix this issue in the 18.3.4 release next February.

image:images/yes.png[yes] It is anticipated that an upcoming release will include a fix for this issue.
